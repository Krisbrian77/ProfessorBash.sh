# ProfessorBash.sh
ChatNBX tune chat LLM AI Chatbot 
It give you access to an an AI chatbot in your command line.

Your run by typing in python filename.py your question and you get your bash script questions and code generated and automatically run and saved to a file directly in bash without having to leave bash to use an AI chatbot to answer your questions or generate your code. 

It also automatically extracts any bash script code from the AIs answers and saves the code to a file, uses chmod command to give permissions to run the bash scripts and runs them. That feature needs work, and i will update and improve it later because this was a project for me to use and works how I need it to work. 

Enjoy it, it comes in handy

ChatNBX aka tune.chat api key is free to use if you signup on their webite and create your api key. 

I use an alias command 
alias Ask="python AskProfessorBash.py" 
Ask my bash script question 

and it returns the answers to my questions directly in bash without having to leave to look up answers to my questions. And it'll also generate and automatically run any bash code generated in the LLM answers. Comes in handy
